# Eventify Project

**Eventify** is an event management application through which users can view available concerts, theaters, exhibitions and other events, access detailed information, and easily navigate between these events and find the ones that suit their preferences. This README file is designed to explain the basic features and usage of the Eventify project.

## Project Description

Eventify offers users the following features:

- View events: Users can review available events through the app.
- Event details: Users can access detailed information for each event, including the event's category, description, date, venue and ticket price.
- Filtering: Users can filter events by type, venue and city, so they can easily find the most suitable event for them.
- Category: Each event has a category, so users can focus on a specific category.
- Image gallery: On the event detail page, pictures of the event are displayed with a slider.
- Search: The app can be searched by event name, type, venue and city.
- Venue-specific events: When you click on the name of a venue or city on Event Detail page, all events taking place at that venue or city are listed.
- Popular events slide: There is a slide with popular events on the homepage.
